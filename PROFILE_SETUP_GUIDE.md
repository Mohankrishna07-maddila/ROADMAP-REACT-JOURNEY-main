ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS website TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS github TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS linkedin TEXT;

-- Update existing profiles to have default values for new columns
UPDATE profiles 
SET 
  location = COALESCE(location, ''),

  github = COALESCE(github, ''),
  linkedin = COALESCE(linkedin, '')
WHERE location IS NULL OR website IS NULL OR github IS NULL OR linkedin IS NULL;
```

### **Step 2: Set Up Storage for Profile Photos**

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create storage bucket for profile photos
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Create storage policy for public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public Access" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Create storage policy for authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload avatars" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Create storage policy for users to update their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatars" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Create storage policy for users to delete their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own avatars" ON storage.objects
